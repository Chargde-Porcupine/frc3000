We are FIRST Robotics Competition Team 3602, The RoboMos, from Escanaba Senior High School in Escanaba, Michigan. Our team was founded back in 2010 and ever since then we have had the great Marie Young and Gabe Kluka as our team lead mentors. We also mentor two FIRST Tech Challenge teams and one FIRST LEGO League team.
